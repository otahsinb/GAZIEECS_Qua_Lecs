   Literatürde 3 çeşit GT versiyonu vardır.
   
   ![GT-versions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54834769/210322863-f1838450-b152-415d-9c0c-6d943bfcd10e.JPG)
   
   Bu 3 versiyon iyi anlaşılmalıdır.\
   GT aslında imperical ya da evidence based nature theory'e dayanır. 
   ![GT1-RH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54834769/210323790-bc3ebb09-e242-4b92-9ab3-2f7cc4e6c293.JPG)

   Yukarıdaki çalışmalarda GT temellerinden bahsediyor yazar.
   
   Öz:\
   GT Alanındaki tecrübeniz nedir sorusu ile başladı.\
   GT sosyolojikal bir method/process/lifecycle/set of steps'dir.1967 yılında Barney Glaser ve Anselm Strauss tarafından tanıtılmıştır (Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research: kütüphanelerden temin edilebilir). Nitel araştırmalar için güçlü olduğu vurgulanmıştır.\
   Systematic ve rigourous bir yaklaşımdır.\
   Focuses on in-depth research of social phenomenon.\
   Inductive approach to evidence-based theory generation. which means collecting up evidence from real world and builing up the theory that bottom mark.\
   Has a powerful data analysis method at its score. Bazen sadece data analizi için kullanılabilir.\
   
   *Theory:*
   
   Data içerisindeki key-patternler nelerdir? \
   What are the relationships between patterns? What are the emergent hypotheses? Aralarındaki linkler nelerdir?\
   GT outcome'ı hypothesis değildir, theorydir. Rigorous bir process'tir. 
 
   ![GT-small-list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54834769/210326748-fb5ffdb9-557f-47e3-ad18-39736ee6fd9a.JPG)
  
  GT çalışmalarını iyi yapan bazı önerilerde bulunulmuştur.
  1. Sistematic ve rigourous olmak için robust ve interleaved GT data collection ve analysis yapılmalıdır.
  2. Theory'nin outcomeları etkili, açık bir şekilde ortaya koyulmalıdır.Örneğin theory statement ve diagram çizimi önemlidir.
Neden grounded theory kullanıyoruz?
1.  GT allows us to adress meaningful, fundamental ve complex questions.
2.  It allows to study human and social aspects of software engineering.
3.  It makes easier to conduct in-depth and multi-faced empirical investigations.
4.  It allows to leverage multiple data types and sources.
5.  It allows achieve rich and multi-layered qualitative analysis.
6.  To present high-quality findings.
7.  It allows to balance research rigour with industrial/pratical relevance.
8.  It allows you to lay theoretical foundations of the problem space to enable useful solutions, tools, techniques development. (? bir düşün) problem space iyi anlaşılmalı.
9.  Develop novel empirically gorunded theories.
10. Recommend guidelines to impact practice. (to help pratitioners)
   
Yazara göre GT çalışmalarının popülaritesi artıyor. Fakat kalite aynı şekilde yükselmiyor. Bunun sebeplerinden 1.'si method'un detaylarının (versiyon gibi) verilmemesi diyor, ikinci sebebi quideline'lara dikkat etmeden a la carte çalışmaların yapılması deniliyor (yani quideline'lara referans verilmeli diyor.), son olarak da methodun yanlış kullanılması diyor.

(Stol, K. J. et al. (2016), Grounded theory in software engineering research: a critical review and guidelines. yayınında rehber referanslar var.)

Kalitesiz yayın çıkmasının arkasındaki durumlar:

1. Eager but not equipped. #EagerButNotEquipped
2. No version control. (Struass-Corbinian, Glaserian, Constructivist) Bir çok kişi GT'nin farklı versiyonların farkında değil ya da farklılıkları nasıl uygulayacağını bilmiyor.
3. GT'yi sadece data analizi için mi kullanacağım? Yoksa FULL GT STUDY mi yapacağım. Bunun kararı kapsamdan kaynaklanan karışıklığı önleyecektir.
4. Geleneksel GT'yi araştırmamıza adapte etmek istiyoruz. Fakat clear rehberler kullanmakta zorlanıyoruz.
5. Araştırmacılar GT kullandığını düşünüyor. Fakat hakkınca uygulamıyor.
6. Araştırmacılar GT çalışmalarını yüksek standardlarda sunmakta zorlanıyor.
7. GT sahada yapılan bir araştırma. Katılımcıların gizliliği veya mahremiyeti içerisinde bulgularına yeterli kanıt sunamıyor. Bulduklarının yanında katılımcıların mahremiyeti de önemli.
8. extreme review işlere giriyorlar.
9. GT was designed by and for sociologists study social phenomena. bu nedenle misalignment problemi olabiliyor. Facade olarak düzgün görünüyorken arka planda farklı yerleşimler olabiliyor.
10. ...?

*Limitations and Opportunities*

1. Written by and for sociologist
2. Assumed expertise and experience (teknik olarak bilgiliyiz fakat bu alan farklı bir alan)
3. 3 versions to understand and select from
4. Designed to be used for theory generation
5. Designed to study social phenomena
6. Designed to use tratitional data, data collection, and analysis

   Link 2: Software process improvement (Coleman and O'Connor, 2007)
   ```bash
   Öz: This research focuses on complex phenomenon. "Using gorunded theory to understand software process improvement: A study of Irish software product companies", Information and Software Technology, 49(6), 654-667.
   Outcomes: Guess, boxes and arrows.
   
The paper "Software Process in Practice: A Grounded Theory of the Irish Software Industry" by Coleman and O'Connor, published in 2007, uses the research method of Grounded theory.
Grounded theory is a research method that aims to develop a theory that is "grounded in" or "emerging from" data collected through observation, interviews, or other methods. This method is commonly used in the social sciences and aims to generate a theoretical understanding of a phenomenon through the systematic collection and analysis of data. The goal of grounded theory is to develop a theory that is consistent with the data and that can be used to explain the phenomenon under study.
   
   
   The research participants are the software development companies and software managers in the indigenous Irish software product industry. The study focused on the approaches used to develop software by companies at various stages of growth in this industry. It is not specified the number of companies and managers that were interviewed, but it is stated that the sample size is sufficient to generate rich data and to validate the findings.
   
   The key findings of the paper "Software Process in Practice: A Grounded Theory of the Irish Software Industry" by Coleman and O'Connor, published in 2007, are:

Software process usage is reactive rather than proactive.
SPI (software process improvement) programmes are implemented reactively.
Many software managers reject SPI because of the associated implementation and maintenance costs.
Software managers are reluctant to implement SPI models such as ISO 9000 and CMMI.
The grounded theory produced by the study is based on two conceptual themes, Process Formation and Process Evolution, and one core theoretical category, Cost of Process.
The study found that the software process usage in the indigenous Irish software product industry is reactive rather than proactive. The research also found that SPI programs are implemented reactively and that many software managers reject SPI due to the associated implementation and maintenance costs, and are reluctant to implement SPI models such as ISO 9000 and CMMI. The study also found that the grounded theory produced by the study is based on two conceptual themes, Process Formation and Process Evolution, and one core theoretical category, Cost of Process.


The paper "Software Process in Practice: A Grounded Theory of the Irish Software Industry" by Coleman and O'Connor, published in 2007, does not explicitly specify the implications of their research. However, based on the key findings, we can infer some possible implications:

1- The reactive rather than proactive approach to software process usage suggests that there is a need for more proactive measures to be taken in order to improve software development processes.

2- The study's finding that software managers are reluctant to implement SPI models such as ISO 9000 and CMMI highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of these models and the benefits they can bring to software development processes.

3- The cost of process as a core theoretical category in the grounded theory suggests that cost considerations should be taken into account when implementing software process improvement programs.

4- The study provides an insight into the Irish software industry, it could be useful for software managers and developers in the Irish software industry and researchers who study the software industry.

5- The study's use of grounded theory methodology provides an interesting perspective on software process and software process improvement, which could be used as a starting point for further research in this field.

It's worth noting that this study is based on a specific sample of Irish Software Industry, and thus the findings might not generalize to other software industries.

   The paper "Multi-level agile project management challenges: A self-organizing team perspective" by Rashina Hoda, published in 2016, uses the research method of a qualitative case study. A case study is a research method that involves an in-depth examination of a particular situation or phenomenon. This method is often used in the social sciences to study complex phenomena in real-life contexts. The qualitative case study approach is used to gain an understanding of a phenomenon through a detailed examination of the case using various data collection methods such as observation, interviews, and document analysis.
   
   *the research participants* are software development teams working in an organization that has adopted agile methodologies. The study was conducted on self-organizing teams that are in charge of their own work processes and are responsible for delivering software products to their customers. The sample size is not specified in the paper but the author conducted in-depth interviews with multiple members of the self-organizing teams, as well as observing the teams during their work processes.
   
1- The study found that self-organizing teams face several challenges in multi-level agile project management, such as balancing the needs of different stakeholders, aligning team goals with organizational goals, and ensuring effective communication and collaboration within the team and with other teams.

2- The study also found that self-organizing teams often struggle with managing changes in requirements, managing dependencies between different teams, and dealing with conflicting priorities and expectations.

3- The study also found that self-organizing teams face challenges in effectively communicating and collaborating with other teams and stakeholders, and in aligning team goals with organizational goals.

4- The study found that self-organizing teams have to constantly balance the needs of different stakeholders, and manage changes in requirements, dependencies between different teams, and conflicting priorities and expectations.

5- The study also found that self-organizing teams face challenges in effectively communicating and collaborating with other teams and stakeholders, and aligning team goals with organizational goals.

6- The study suggests that effective leadership, clear communication, and regular alignment of team and organizational goals can help mitigate these challenges.

It's worth noting that this study is based on a specific sample of self-organizing teams working in an organization that has adopted agile methodologies, and thus the findings might not generalize to other organizations or teams.

1- The study highlights the challenges that self-organizing teams face in multi-level agile project management, such as balancing the needs of different stakeholders, aligning team goals with organizational goals, and ensuring effective communication and collaboration within the team and with other teams. This could be useful for software development managers, developers, and project managers in understanding how to manage competing demands and different perspectives.

2- The findings of the study could be useful for organizations that are planning to implement or are already implementing agile methodologies, particularly for self-organizing teams.

3- The study suggests that effective leadership, clear communication, and regular alignment of team and organizational goals can help mitigate these challenges, this can be used by organizations as a starting point for improving their agile project management.

4- The study's use of qualitative case study methodology provides an interesting perspective on challenges that self-organizing teams face in multi-level agile project management, which could be used as a starting point for further research in this field.

   Öz: uses the research method of Socio-Technical Grounded Theory. It is a combination of Grounded theory, which is a research method that aims to develop a theory that is "grounded in" or "emerging from" data collected through observation, interviews, or other methods, and socio-technical theory, which emphasizes the interdependence between social and technical systems and how they shape and are shaped by each other. This method is commonly used in the field of software engineering to study the relationship between social and technical aspects of software development and how they impact the process and outcome of software development. The goal of socio-technical grounded theory is to develop a theory that is consistent with the data and that can be used to explain the phenomenon under study.
   
   the research participants are software development teams and individuals working in software development organizations. The study was conducted on software development teams that are using Agile methodologies.

   The paper "Reconciling perspectives: A grounded theory of how people manage the process of software development" by Steve Adolph and Philippe Kruchten, published in 2012, uses the research method of Grounded theory.
Grounded theory is a research method that aims to develop a theory that is "grounded in" or "emerging from" data collected through observation, interviews, or other methods. This method is commonly used in the social sciences and aims to generate a theoretical understanding of a phenomenon through the systematic collection and analysis of data. The goal of grounded theory is to develop a theory that is consistent with the data and that can be used to explain the phenomenon under study.

the research participants were software development managers, developers and project managers working in the software industry. The authors of the paper used purposive sampling to select their participants, meaning that they selected their participants based on specific criteria they had set, such as experience in software development, familiarity with a specific software development process model, and the ability to speak English. The sample size is not specified in the paper, but the authors stated that they interviewed a total of 23 participants, and that the sample size was sufficient to generate rich data and to validate the findings.

**Key Findings**

1- People managing the process of software development are constantly facing the challenge of reconciling different perspectives, such as the perspective of the development team, the perspective of the management, and the perspective of the customer.

2- They use a process of balancing, which includes the following elements: balancing the needs of different stakeholders, balancing the trade-offs between quality, schedule, and budget, and balancing the competing demands of different development processes.

3- They also use a process of creating, which includes the following elements: creating a shared understanding of the project, creating a shared vision of the project, and creating a shared commitment to the project.

4- The study found that people managing the process of software development have to constantly balance the needs of different stakeholders, trade-offs between quality, schedule, and budget, and the competing demands of different development processes.

5- The study also found that people managing the process of software development have to create a shared understanding, vision and commitment to the project among the stakeholders.

6- The authors developed a grounded theory of how people manage the process of software development, which they called “Reconciling perspectives”.

It's worth noting that this study is based on a specific sample of software development managers, developers and project managers, and thus the findings might not generalize to other software development teams or industries.
  
  
we can infer some possible implications:\

1- The study highlights the importance of reconciling different perspectives in software development and the need for a process of balancing and creating among stakeholders. This could be useful for software development managers, developers, and project managers in understanding how to manage competing demands and different perspectives.

2- The findings of the study could be used as a starting point for further research in software development management, specifically in the area of balancing and creating shared understanding, vision and commitment among stakeholders.

3- The study could be useful for software development managers and teams, software process improvement practitioners and researchers studying software development management.

4- The study's use of grounded theory methodology provides an interesting perspective on software development management, which could be used as a starting point for further research in this field.

   Öz:  How agile teams make self-assignment work: a grounded theory study
   
   the research participants are agile software development teams working in different organizations. The study was conducted on software development teams that are using Agile methodologies and self-assignment of tasks. The sample size is not specified in the paper but the author conducted interviews with multiple members of the agile software development teams, as well as observing the teams during their work processes. The author used a combination of purposive and snowball sampling to select his participants.
   
   The study found that self-assignment, where team members are responsible for selecting and completing their own tasks, can be successful when the following elements are present:

1- Clear Team Goals: Teams have clear and well-defined goals that are aligned with the overall organization's objectives.

2- Trust: Team members trust each other and the process of self-assignment.

3- Communication: Effective communication among team members is present, which enables them to collaborate and coordinate effectively.

4- Empowerment: Team members feel empowered to take ownership of their tasks and make decisions.
